# Face-Recognition-QR-Code-Based-Attendance-Security-System

Hello Everyone this is Ankit Bhatia, Student Full-Stack Developer pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science

This is one of my project's in Java-Python Developement field  which i have created,basically Java and Python Based 
Student Security Attendance System called Staysafe Security System that uses the property of Real-Time Face Recognition as well as QR Based Attendence Punching by the students.

- Students punch their attendence using QR Code on their ID Cards over the inbuilt application webcam QR scanner.

- Before punching the attendence they need to scan their face onto the webcam/camera to ensure they are the same as they are labelled to be for the case of security.


- On sucessfull punching their QR Code, attendence will be punched and a Message will be sent to their guardians on their safe arrival in school


- Functionality for Admin /School

			* Creation of daily attendence report,complete student record,and monthy attendence record of each child.

			* Sending SMS to absent as well as present students(and how much late they are to school) to their guardian mobile number

			* Creating new student profile,QR code if a new student takes admission in School.


### * Language Used: Java and Python

### * Database Used: MYSQL


### * Python used for creating QR Code Scan,Face Recoginiton as well QR Code Creation faciltity

### * Project Front-End is created using JavaFX library.

### * For GSM SMS feature FAST2SMS Message API has been used for sending messages.
